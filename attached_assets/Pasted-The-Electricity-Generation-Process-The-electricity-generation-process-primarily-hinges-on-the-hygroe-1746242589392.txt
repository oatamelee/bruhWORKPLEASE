The Electricity Generation Process
The electricity generation process primarily hinges on the hygroelectric effect, a phenomenon where moisture gradients in the environment induce electric potential across a material.

Here's how the system works step-by-step:

Moisture Adsorption: The protein nanowire film adsorbs water molecules from the air, which increases the local water activity \( a_w \). The rate of moisture absorption is governed by the diffusion equation:
∂C/∂t = D ∇²C
where \( C \) is the concentration of water molecules, \( t \) is time, \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient, and \( \nabla² \) represents the Laplacian operator describing the spatial variation of water concentration.
Charge Gradient Formation: As water molecules diffuse through the nanowire network, they create a humidity gradient \( \nabla RH \). This generates an electric field \( E \) due to asymmetric charge distribution. The potential difference is described by:
∇·E = ρ/ε
where \( ρ \) is the charge density, and \( ε \) is the permittivity of the material.
Protonic and Electronic Conduction: The absorbed moisture facilitates proton hopping (Grotthuss mechanism) and electron movement along the nanowires. The current density \( J \) can be described by:
J = σ · E
where \( σ \) is the conductivity of the material, and \( E \) is the electric field generated across the material. The equation for the total current \( I \) is given by:
I = ∫ J dA
where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area through which the current flows.
Continuous Generation: As long as atmospheric moisture is present, the process continues. The voltage output, in the absence of moving parts or chemical depletion, can be modeled as:
V(t) = ∫ σ(t) · E(t) dt
where \( V(t) \) is the voltage at time \( t \), \( σ(t) \) is the time-varying conductivity, and \( E(t) \) is the time-varying electric field.
This device behaves like a nano-scale moisture-to-electricity generator, capable of generating 0.5 V per square centimeter. The system is scalable through multilayer configurations, where each layer contributes to the total voltage:
Vtotal = Vunit × n
where Vunit is the voltage generated by a single unit layer, and n is the number of stacked layers.
